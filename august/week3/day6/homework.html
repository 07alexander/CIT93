<h1>Homework Week 3 Day 6 : Udemy - JavaScript the Weird Parts</h1>
<h2>Section 1 Lecture 1 - Introduction to the Course</h2>
<ul>
    <li>This course is all about understanding JavaScript</li>
    <li>JavaScript falsely looks like other programming languages: C++, Java, C# </li>
    <li>Don't imitate, understand!</li>
    <li>Don't parrot other coding examples, understand the concepts</li>
</ul>
<h2>Section 1 Lecture 3 - Big Word Alert</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In Computer Science and programming, there's a tendency to use words that sound a lot bigger and more complicated than they are actually describing </li>
    <li>When you see the BIG WORD ALERT, that means we're about to discuss a word that's probably a lot less complicated than it sounds</li>
    <li>This is an under-the-hood course so don't be intimidated by the words and terms that we may use.</li>
    <li>Remember, it's just vocabulary</li>
</ul>
<h2>Section 1 Lecture 5 - Understanding, Frameworks and the Weird Parts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The open source communities have developed JavaScript libraries and frameworks: JQuery and AngularJS</li>
    <li>First we must have a deeper understanding of JavaScript before we delve into frameworks</li>
    <li>At the end we are going to try and build mini framework similar to JQuery or AngularJS</li>
</ul>
<h2>Section 2 Lecture 6 - Conceptual Aside: Syntax Parsers, Execution Contexts, and Lexical Environments</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Syntax Parser: A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if it's grammar is valid</li>
    <li>Your code isn't magic, someone else wrote a program to translate it for a computer</li>
    <li>Lexical Environment: Where something sits physically in the code you write</li>
    <li>Exists in programming languages in which where you write something is important</li>
    <li>Execution Context: A wrapper to help manage the code that is running</li>
    <li>There are lots of lexical environments. Which one is currently running is managed via execution contexts. It can contain things beyond what you've written in your code</li>
</ul>
<h2>Section 2 Lecture 7 - Conceptual Aside: Name/Value Pairs and Objects</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Name/Value Pair: A name which maps to a unique value</li>
    <li>The name be defined more than once, but only can have one value in any given context. That value may be more name/value pairs.</li>
    <li>Object: A collection of name value pairs</li>
    <li>The simplest definition when talking about JavaScript</li>
    <li>It's just that simple</li>
</ul>
