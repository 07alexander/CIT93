<h1>Classwork Day 28</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Login (FireBase or Local Storage) with Form Validation and Logout</li>
    <p>Finally got Firebase login sorted out, now it correctly logs in to the main function</p>
    <p>All the error codes that I had last week were due to the javascript language version was set to ECMA Script 5.1, changing it to ECMA Script 6 fixed everything </p>
    <p>I also decided to scrap most of my old project to focus on implementing firebase to my app, I did this because it was too confusing to try and piece together the new and old code</p>
    <p>one problem im trying to sort out is that the "hide" in the class isn't working for me. The log out button is always shown and I can't hide my login or signup when I log in to the app</p>
