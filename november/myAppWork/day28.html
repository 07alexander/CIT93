<h1>Classwork Day 28</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Login (FireBase or Local Storage) with Form Validation and Logout</li>
    <p>Firebase is working on login, but I'm still having a lot of trouble, I'm getting a lot errors and I don't understand why.
    The errors aren't preventing me from testing the index, but the errors are a bother to me.</p>
    <img src="img/errors.png">
    <li>Sign Up (FireBase or Local Storage) with Form Validation</li>
    <p>Will implement FireBase for Sign Up authorization and storage, still only have temporary storage and Sign Up</p>
    <li>Present User Specific Data into login</li>
    <p>Login will have show user specific lists and tasks, maybe will implement custom background images or colors</p>
    <li>Handle the User Specific Sign-up Data Capture</li>
    <p>To use FireBase Database to have unique sign ups and users</p>
    <li>Implement some GeoLocation functionality</li>
    <p>Not sure how I will implement GeoLocation for my web application, maybe to check GeoLocation for Daylight savings according area, or maybe time zones</p>
    <li>Implement something with AJAX functionality</li>
    <p>To implement AJAX to sync  Lists, tasks, completed tasks with server side</p>
    <li>Do user testing</li>
    <p>User testing completed for prototype, but still need to do user testing for FireBase implementation</p>
    <li><b>Side Notes:</b></li>
    <p>Currently my main focus is to transition everything to work with FireBase. I'm not sure if I should scrap everything and rebuild everything from the ground up as to avoid any conflicting code. Or should I keep trying to meld everything together. It's frustrating to have to throw away code that I took forever to implement. Hopefully I will at least getting FireBase up and running the way I would like over this weekend.</p>
