<h1>Classwork Day 32</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Fixed login button to only login with credentials, before: clicking on login button will allow you to login without entering anything into forms</li>
    <li>Fixed 'hide' functionailty, index was linked to the wrong style.css location.</li>
    <li>Log out button is now hidden until logged in</li>
    <li>login and sign up button is now hidden when logged in</li>
    <li>Title is now hidden correctly</li>
    <li>Progress is slow, but I'm starting to get the hang of firebase, I literally spent hours trying to figure out how to get 'hide' working and it turned out to be a small thing</li>
    <li>firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged was tricky too, I kept calling my showMain() inside promise.catch() on the login button, but I think I understand it now, starting to make a lot of sense</li>
</ol>
