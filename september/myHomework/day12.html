<h1>Homework Week 6 Day 12 : Udemy - JavaScript the Weird Parts</h1>

<h2>Section 3 Lecture 19 - Conceptual Aside: Types and Javascript</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Dynamic Typing: You don't tell the engine what type of data a variable holds, it figures it out while your code is running</li>
    <li>Variables can hold different types of values because it's all figured out during execution</li>
    <li>Static Typing: Telling the engine ahead of time what variable what type it should hold</li>
    <li>Javascript uses dynamic typing, it figures it out on the fly</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 3 Lecture 20 - Primitive Types</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Primitive Type: A type of data that represents a single value; that is, not an object.</li>
    <li>Undefined represents lack of existence (you shouldn't set a variable to this</li>
    <li>Null represents lack of existence(you can set a variable to this)</li>
    <li>Boolean, true or false</li>
    <li>Number, Floating point number (there's always some decimals). Unlike other programmming languaues, there's only one 'number' type.. and it can make it weird.</li>
    <li>String, a sequence of characters (both "and" can be used)</li>
    <li>Symbol, Used in ES6(the next version of Javascript) We won't talk about this here...</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 3 Lecture 21 - Conceptual Aside: Operators</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Operators: A special function that is syntactically(written) differently</li>
    <li>Generally, operators take two parameters and return one result</li>
    <li>Javascript allows for infix notation to make it more human readable</li>
    <li>Infix means that the function name, the operator, sits between the two parameters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 3 Lecture 22 - Operator Precedence and Associativity</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Operator Precedence: Which operator function gets called first; Functions are called in order of precedence (Higher precedence wins)</li>
    <li>Associativity: What order operator functions get called in: Left-to-Right or Right-to-Left; When functions have the same precedence</li>
    <li>The assignment operator has a Right to Left Associativity, variables and parameters will be processed from right to left</li>
    <li>The grouping operator (parenthesis) have the highest precedence so whatever code is within the parenthesis get's called first </li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 3 Lecture 24 - Conceptual Aside: Coercion</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Coercion: Converting a value from one type to another; This happens quite often in
    Javascript because it's dynamically typed./li>
    <li>Javascript is dynamically typed so it tends to try to convert things to the value that you want</li>
    <li>Coercion of data types happens under the hood and doesn't change your code</li>
    <li>So, we understand that Javascript is doing its best to understand what something should be. Because it's dynamically typed and that coercion is a fundamental part of JavaScript language as a result</li>
</ul>
