<h1>Homework Day 21</h1>
<p>
    Most of the storage that I need for my app, is just the login credentials. Also I would need to store the users tasks and be able to delete them. Maybe implement a temporary history storage that deletes after a certain amount of time. But I will try to focus on the small stuff first, before I try to jump on trying to store everything. I'm going to focus more on local storage because I don't know how I can use session storage for my app as of right now. 
</p>
<h2>Local storage for app</h2>
<p>
    <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp">Local Storage Resource</a>
    I think I'm going to use some of the local storage methods provided for html, from the link. <br>

</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<pre class="prettyprint">
// Store
localStorage.setItem("lastname", "Smith");
// Retrieve
document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = localStorage.getItem("lastname");

    // Store
localStorage.lastname = "Smith";
// Retrieve
document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = localStorage.lastname;

    localStorage.removeItem("lastname");


    if (localStorage.clickcount) {
    localStorage.clickcount = Number(localStorage.clickcount) + 1;
} else {
    localStorage.clickcount = 1;
}
document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "You have clicked the button " +
localStorage.clickcount + " time(s).";
</pre>
<h2>Session Storage</h2>
<p>
    I think I might also try using session Storage, where the data is only stored for only one session, the data seleted when the user closes the specific browser tab
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    if (sessionStorage.clickcount) {
    sessionStorage.clickcount = Number(sessionStorage.clickcount) + 1;
} else {
    sessionStorage.clickcount = 1;
}
document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "You have clicked the button " +
sessionStorage.clickcount + " time(s) in this session.";
</pre>
</body>
